;; and brighter; it simply makes everything else vanish."
;; -Neal Stephenson, "In the Beginning was the Command Line"

(setq dotfiles-dir (file-name-directory

(setq system-specific-config (concat dotfiles-dir system-name ".el")
      user-specific-config (concat dotfiles-dir user-login-name ".el"))
